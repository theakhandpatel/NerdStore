	* `POSTGRES_USER`
	* `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
	* `POSTGRES_DB`
3. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the containers in detached mode
4. The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### Local Development Environment

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
